Visualizing voter turnout in US general elections.

The data were obtained [here](http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/voter-turnout-data), specifically [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1or-N33CpOZYQ1UfZo0h8yGPSyz0Db-xjmZOXg3VJi-Q). Voter turnout is calculated as the highest office counted divided by the voting eligible population (VEP) (both columns need to have commas removed).

Code [here](https://github.com/jarad/voter_turnout).

Here is another voter turnout app <http://www.latinovotemap.org/map/> which allows you to see how the presidental election would change depending on the percentage of the votes that come from latinos and the percentage of latinos that vote for the GOP.
