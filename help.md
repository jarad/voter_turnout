Visualizing voter turnout in US general elections.

The data were obtained [here](http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/voter-turnout-data). The entire spreadsheet was downloaded as voter_turnout.csv (available in the code link below) and the voter turnout is calculated as the highest office counted divided by the voting eligible population (VEP).
